# Tic-Tac-Toe-2-Players

This is a simple drag and drop tic tac toe game for 2 players. I made this during my second week of code bootcamp in my personal time in order to get in the habit of making some personal projects. 

Pure CSS/Pure JS.


### Prerequisites

For now, the assets are imported via links.


### Issues

Their are problems with cross browser compatibility as I haven't really done any webkit vendor prefixing. I will be looking to do so as I have had problems running the audio in Chrome browers.
